# Baseline Experiments

This directory contains baseline experiment scripts and reference implementations used during development.

## Purpose

These scripts serve as:
- Reference implementations for comparison
- Baseline performance benchmarks
- Historical record of experimental approaches

## Contents

- Baseline model architectures
- Initial training experiments
- Performance comparison scripts
- Ablation study implementations

## Note

These are historical reference implementations. For current experiments, see the `experiments/` directory in the main codebase.
